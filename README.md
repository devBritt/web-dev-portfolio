> AS AN employer
> I WANT to view a potential employee's eployed portfolio of work samples
> SO THAT I can review samples of their work and asses whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

**Acceptance Criteria**
> GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work:
> WHEN I load their portfolio, I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.
> WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
> WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work, the UI scrolls to asection with titled images of the developer's applications.
> WHEN I am presented with the developer's first applications, that application's image should be larger in size than the others.

## Lessons Learned

Working on my portfolio allowed me to gain experience creating a responsive website.
It also allowed me to practice troubleshooting and being self-sufficient when trying to solve problems that popped up.
There were several moments that had me frustrated because I couldn't find the answers I needed, only to find that I was simply asking the wrong questions.

                Brittany Carlton is currently a coding bootcamp student with the dream of becoming a frontend developer. Her passion for bringing beautiful, interactive, and responsive web apps to life grows every day! She has experience in game design and development, graphic design, and UX/UI design which gives her the ability to see projects from different perspectives.
            </p>
            <p>
                Brittany has often been called a 'forever student' by those who know her as she is always looking to develop her professional skills and stay up to date with the latest and greatest in tech. She has led numerous team projects throughout her extensive academic career and graduated at the top of her class with honors to earn her Bachelor's in Interactive Media Design from Franklin University. At the end of her coding bootcamp journey, she will earn a certificate from the prestigious Case Western Reserve University.
            </p>
            <p>
                When she isn't coding, she loves spending time with her wonderful husband, Josh. They have 3 silly and loveable fur babies - Sirabi, Stormy, and Meliodas - whom they dote on endlessly. Brittany also enjoys reading, playing video and tabletop games, and dreaming of far-off lands that she hopes to visit one day.
